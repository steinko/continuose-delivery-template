/**
 * Three different resources help you manage your IAM policy for Cloud AI Notebooks Instance. Each of these resources serves a different use case:
 *
 * * `gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamPolicy`: Authoritative. Sets the IAM policy for the instance and replaces any existing policy already attached.
 * * `gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamBinding`: Authoritative for a given role. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a list of members. Other roles within the IAM policy for the instance are preserved.
 * * `gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamMember`: Non-authoritative. Updates the IAM policy to grant a role to a new member. Other members for the role for the instance are preserved.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamPolicy` **cannot** be used in conjunction with `gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamBinding` and `gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamMember` or they will fight over what your policy should be.
 *
 * > **Note:** `gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamBinding` resources **can be** used in conjunction with `gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamMember` resources **only if** they do not grant privilege to the same role.
 *
 * ## google\_notebooks\_instance\_iam\_policy
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const admin = gcp.organizations.getIAMPolicy({
 *     bindings: [{
 *         role: "roles/viewer",
 *         members: ["user:jane@example.com"],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const policy = new gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamPolicy("policy", {
 *     project: google_notebooks_instance.instance.project,
 *     location: google_notebooks_instance.instance.location,
 *     instanceName: google_notebooks_instance.instance.name,
 *     policyData: admin.then(admin => admin.policyData),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## google\_notebooks\_instance\_iam\_binding
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const binding = new gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamBinding("binding", {
 *     project: google_notebooks_instance.instance.project,
 *     location: google_notebooks_instance.instance.location,
 *     instanceName: google_notebooks_instance.instance.name,
 *     role: "roles/viewer",
 *     members: ["user:jane@example.com"],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## google\_notebooks\_instance\_iam\_member
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const member = new gcp.notebooks.InstanceIamMember("member", {
 *     project: google_notebooks_instance.instance.project,
 *     location: google_notebooks_instance.instance.location,
 *     instanceName: google_notebooks_instance.instance.name,
 *     role: "roles/viewer",
 *     member: "user:jane@example.com",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * For all import syntaxes, the "resource in question" can take any of the following forms* projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_name}} * {{project}}/{{location}}/{{instance_name}} * {{location}}/{{instance_name}} * {{instance_name}} Any variables not passed in the import command will be taken from the provider configuration. Cloud AI Notebooks instance IAM resources can be imported using the resource identifiers, role, and member. IAM member imports use space-delimited identifiersthe resource in question, the role, and the member identity, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:notebooks/instanceIamMember:InstanceIamMember editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_name}} roles/viewer user:jane@example.com"
 * ```
 *
 *  IAM binding imports use space-delimited identifiersthe resource in question and the role, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:notebooks/instanceIamMember:InstanceIamMember editor "projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_name}} roles/viewer"
 * ```
 *
 *  IAM policy imports use the identifier of the resource in question, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:notebooks/instanceIamMember:InstanceIamMember editor projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/instances/{{instance_name}}
 * ```
 *
 *  -> **Custom Roles**If you're importing a IAM resource with a custom role, make sure to use the
 *
 * full name of the custom role, e.g. `[projects/my-project|organizations/my-org]/roles/my-custom-role`.
