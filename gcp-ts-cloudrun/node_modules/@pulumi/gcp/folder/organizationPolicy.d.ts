/**
 * Allows management of Organization policies for a Google Folder. For more information see
 * [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview) and
 * [API](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/folders/setOrgPolicy).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * To set policy with a [boolean constraint](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/quickstart-boolean-constraints):
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const serialPortPolicy = new gcp.folder.OrganizationPolicy("serial_port_policy", {
 *     booleanPolicy: {
 *         enforced: true,
 *     },
 *     constraint: "compute.disableSerialPortAccess",
 *     folder: "folders/123456789",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * To set a policy with a [list constraint](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/quickstart-list-constraints):
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const servicesPolicy = new gcp.folder.OrganizationPolicy("services_policy", {
 *     constraint: "serviceuser.services",
 *     folder: "folders/123456789",
 *     listPolicy: {
 *         allow: {
 *             all: true,
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Or to deny some services, use the following instead:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const servicesPolicy = new gcp.folder.OrganizationPolicy("services_policy", {
 *     constraint: "serviceuser.services",
 *     folder: "folders/123456789",
 *     listPolicy: {
 *         deny: {
 *             values: ["cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com"],
 *         },
 *         suggestedValue: "compute.googleapis.com",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * To restore the default folder organization policy, use the following instead:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const servicesPolicy = new gcp.folder.OrganizationPolicy("services_policy", {
 *     constraint: "serviceuser.services",
 *     folder: "folders/123456789",
 *     restorePolicy: {
 *         default: true,
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Folder organization policies can be imported using any of the follow formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:folder/organizationPolicy:OrganizationPolicy policy folders/folder-1234/constraints/serviceuser.services
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:folder/organizationPolicy:OrganizationPolicy policy folder-1234/serviceuser.services
 * ```
