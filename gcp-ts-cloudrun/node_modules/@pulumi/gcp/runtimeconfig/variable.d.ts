 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Runtime Config Variables can be imported using the `name` or full variable name, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:runtimeconfig/variable:Variable myvariable myconfig/myvariable
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:runtimeconfig/variable:Variable myvariable projects/my-gcp-project/configs/myconfig/variables/myvariable
 * ```
 *
 *  When importing using only the name, the provider project must be set.
