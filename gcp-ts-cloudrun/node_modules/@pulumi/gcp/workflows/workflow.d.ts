/**
 * Workflow program to be executed by Workflows.
 *
 * To get more information about Workflow, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/workflows/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.workflows)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Managing Workflows](https://cloud.google.com/workflows/docs/creating-updating-workflow)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Workflow Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const testAccount = new gcp.serviceAccount.Account("testAccount", {
 *     accountId: "my-account",
 *     displayName: "Test Service Account",
 * });
 * const example = new gcp.workflows.Workflow("example", {
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     description: "Magic",
 *     serviceAccount: testAccount.id,
 *     sourceContents: `# This is a sample workflow, feel free to replace it with your source code
 * #
 * # This workflow does the following:
 * # - reads current time and date information from an external API and stores
 * #   the response in CurrentDateTime variable
 * # - retrieves a list of Wikipedia articles related to the day of the week
 * #   from CurrentDateTime
 * # - returns the list of articles as an output of the workflow
 * # FYI, In terraform you need to escape the $$ or it will cause errors.
 *
 * - getCurrentTime:
 *     call: http.get
 *     args:
 *         url: https://us-central1-workflowsample.cloudfunctions.net/datetime
 *     result: CurrentDateTime
 * - readWikipedia:
 *     call: http.get
 *     args:
 *         url: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php
 *         query:
 *             action: opensearch
 *             search: ${CurrentDateTime.body.dayOfTheWeek}
 *     result: WikiResult
 * - returnOutput:
 *     return: ${WikiResult.body[1]}
 * `,
 * });
 * ```
