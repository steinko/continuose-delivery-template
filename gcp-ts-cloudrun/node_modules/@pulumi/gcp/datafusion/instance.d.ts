/**
 * Represents a Data Fusion instance.
 *
 * To get more information about Instance, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/data-fusion/docs/reference/rest/v1beta1/projects.locations.instances)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/data-fusion/docs/)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Data Fusion Instance Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const basicInstance = new gcp.datafusion.Instance("basicInstance", {
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     type: "BASIC",
 * }, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Data Fusion Instance Full
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const default = gcp.appengine.getDefaultServiceAccount({});
 * const extendedInstance = new gcp.datafusion.Instance("extendedInstance", {
 *     description: "My Data Fusion instance",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     type: "BASIC",
 *     enableStackdriverLogging: true,
 *     enableStackdriverMonitoring: true,
 *     labels: {
 *         example_key: "example_value",
 *     },
 *     privateInstance: true,
 *     networkConfig: {
 *         network: "default",
 *         ipAllocation: "10.89.48.0/22",
 *     },
 *     version: "6.3.0",
 *     dataprocServiceAccount: _default.then(_default => _default.email),
 * }, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Instance can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:datafusion/instance:Instance default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{region}}/instances/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:datafusion/instance:Instance default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:datafusion/instance:Instance default {{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:datafusion/instance:Instance default {{name}}
 * ```
