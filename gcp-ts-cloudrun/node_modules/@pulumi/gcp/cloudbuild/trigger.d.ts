 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Cloudbuild Trigger Filename
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const filename_trigger = new gcp.cloudbuild.Trigger("filename-trigger", {
 *     filename: "cloudbuild.yaml",
 *     substitutions: {
 *         _BAZ: "qux",
 *         _FOO: "bar",
 *     },
 *     triggerTemplate: {
 *         branchName: "master",
 *         repoName: "my-repo",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Cloudbuild Trigger Build
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
