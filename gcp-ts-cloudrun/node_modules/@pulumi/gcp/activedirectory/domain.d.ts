 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Managed Microsoft Active Directory Quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/managed-microsoft-ad/docs/quickstarts)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Active Directory Domain Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const ad_domain = new gcp.activedirectory.Domain("ad-domain", {
 *     domainName: "tfgen.org.com",
 *     locations: ["us-central1"],
 *     reservedIpRange: "192.168.255.0/24",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Domain can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:activedirectory/domain:Domain default {{name}}
 * ```
