/**
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/billingAccounts.sinks)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Exporting Logs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export)
 *
 * > **Note** You must have the "Logs Configuration Writer" IAM role (`roles/logging.configWriter`)
 * [granted on the billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/reference/rest/v1/billingAccounts/getIamPolicy) to
 * the credentials used with this provider. [IAM roles granted on a billing account](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/billing-access) are separate from the
 * typical IAM roles granted on a project.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const log_bucket = new gcp.storage.Bucket("log-bucket", {});
 * const my_sink = new gcp.logging.BillingAccountSink("my-sink", {
 *     description: "some explaination on what this is",
 *     billingAccount: "ABCDEF-012345-GHIJKL",
 *     destination: pulumi.interpolate`storage.googleapis.com/${log_bucket.name}`,
 * });
 * const log_writer = new gcp.projects.IAMBinding("log-writer", {
 *     role: "roles/storage.objectCreator",
 *     members: [my_sink.writerIdentity],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Billing account logging sinks can be imported using this format
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:logging/billingAccountSink:BillingAccountSink my_sink billingAccounts/{{billing_account_id}}/sinks/{{sink_id}}
 * ```
