/**
 * Backend buckets allow you to use Google Cloud Storage buckets with HTTP(S)
 * load balancing.
 *
 * An HTTP(S) load balancer can direct traffic to specified URLs to a
 * backend bucket rather than a backend service. It can send requests for
 * static content to a Cloud Storage bucket and requests for dynamic content
 * to a virtual machine instance.
 *
 * To get more information about BackendBucket, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/v1/backendBuckets)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Using a Cloud Storage bucket as a load balancer backend](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/backend-bucket)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Backend Bucket Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const imageBucket = new gcp.storage.Bucket("imageBucket", {location: "EU"});
 * const imageBackend = new gcp.compute.BackendBucket("imageBackend", {
 *     description: "Contains beautiful images",
 *     bucketName: imageBucket.name,
 *     enableCdn: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * BackendBucket can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/backendBucket:BackendBucket default projects/{{project}}/global/backendBuckets/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/backendBucket:BackendBucket default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/backendBucket:BackendBucket default {{name}}
 * ```
