/**
 * Represents a SSL policy. SSL policies give you the ability to control the
 * features of SSL that your SSL proxy or HTTPS load balancer negotiates.
 *
 * To get more information about SslPolicy, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/sslPolicies)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Using SSL Policies](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/ssl-policies)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Ssl Policy Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const prod_ssl_policy = new gcp.compute.SSLPolicy("prod-ssl-policy", {
 *     profile: "MODERN",
 * });
 * const nonprod_ssl_policy = new gcp.compute.SSLPolicy("nonprod-ssl-policy", {
 *     minTlsVersion: "TLS_1_2",
 *     profile: "MODERN",
 * });
 * const custom_ssl_policy = new gcp.compute.SSLPolicy("custom-ssl-policy", {
 *     customFeatures: [
 *         "TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
 *         "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384",
 *     ],
 *     minTlsVersion: "TLS_1_2",
 *     profile: "CUSTOM",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * SslPolicy can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/sSLPolicy:SSLPolicy default projects/{{project}}/global/sslPolicies/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/sSLPolicy:SSLPolicy default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/sSLPolicy:SSLPolicy default {{name}}
 * ```
