import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Represents a TargetHttpProxy resource, which is used by one or more global
 * forwarding rule to route incoming HTTP requests to a URL map.
 *
 * To get more information about TargetHttpProxy, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/v1/targetHttpProxies)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/http/target-proxies)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Target Http Proxy Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultHttpHealthCheck = new gcp.compute.HttpHealthCheck("defaultHttpHealthCheck", {
 *     requestPath: "/",
 *     checkIntervalSec: 1,
 *     timeoutSec: 1,
 * });
 * const defaultBackendService = new gcp.compute.BackendService("defaultBackendService", {
 *     portName: "http",
 *     protocol: "HTTP",
 *     timeoutSec: 10,
 *     healthChecks: [defaultHttpHealthCheck.id],
 * });
 * const defaultURLMap = new gcp.compute.URLMap("defaultURLMap", {
 *     defaultService: defaultBackendService.id,
 *     hostRules: [{
 *         hosts: ["mysite.com"],
 *         pathMatcher: "allpaths",
 *     }],
 *     pathMatchers: [{
 *         name: "allpaths",
 *         defaultService: defaultBackendService.id,
 *         pathRules: [{
 *             paths: ["/*"],
 *             service: defaultBackendService.id,
 *         }],
 *     }],
 * });
 * const defaultTargetHttpProxy = new gcp.compute.TargetHttpProxy("defaultTargetHttpProxy", {urlMap: defaultURLMap.id});
 * ```
 * ### Target Http Proxy Https Redirect
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultURLMap = new gcp.compute.URLMap("defaultURLMap", {defaultUrlRedirect: {
 *     httpsRedirect: true,
 *     stripQuery: false,
 * }});
 * const defaultTargetHttpProxy = new gcp.compute.TargetHttpProxy("defaultTargetHttpProxy", {urlMap: defaultURLMap.id});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * TargetHttpProxy can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/targetHttpProxy:TargetHttpProxy default projects/{{project}}/global/targetHttpProxies/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/targetHttpProxy:TargetHttpProxy default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/targetHttpProxy:TargetHttpProxy default {{name}}
 * ```
