 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultAccount = new gcp.serviceAccount.Account("defaultAccount", {
 *     accountId: "service_account_id",

 * });
 * const defaultInstance = new gcp.compute.Instance("defaultInstance", {
 *     machineType: "e2-medium",
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",
 *     tags: [
 *         "foo",
 *         "bar",
 *     ],
 *     bootDisk: {
 *         initializeParams: {
 *             image: "debian-cloud/debian-9",
 *         },
 *     },
 *     scratchDisks: [{
 *         "interface": "SCSI",
 *     }],
 *     networkInterfaces: [{
 *         network: "default",
 *         accessConfigs: [{}],
 *     }],
 *     metadata: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 *     metadataStartupScript: "echo hi > /test.txt",
 *     serviceAccount: {
 *         email: defaultAccount.email,
 *         scopes: ["cloud-platform"],
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Instances can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/instance:Instance default projects/{{project}}/zones/{{zone}}/instances/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/instance:Instance default {{project}}/{{zone}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/instance:Instance default {{name}}
 * ```
