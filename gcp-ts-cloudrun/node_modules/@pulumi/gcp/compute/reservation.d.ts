/**
 * Represents a reservation resource. A reservation ensures that capacity is
 * held in a specific zone even if the reserved VMs are not running.
 *
 * Reservations apply only to Compute Engine, Cloud Dataproc, and Google
 * Kubernetes Engine VM usage.Reservations do not apply to `f1-micro` or
 * `g1-small` machine types, preemptible VMs, sole tenant nodes, or other
 * services not listed above
 * like Cloud SQL and Dataflow.
 *
 * To get more information about Reservation, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/reservations)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Reserving zonal resources](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/reserving-zonal-resources)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Reservation Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const gceReservation = new gcp.compute.Reservation("gce_reservation", {
 *     specificReservation: {
 *         count: 1,
 *         instanceProperties: {
 *             machineType: "n2-standard-2",
 *             minCpuPlatform: "Intel Cascade Lake",
 *         },
 *     },
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Reservation can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/reservation:Reservation default projects/{{project}}/zones/{{zone}}/reservations/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/reservation:Reservation default {{project}}/{{zone}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/reservation:Reservation default {{zone}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/reservation:Reservation default {{name}}
 * ```
