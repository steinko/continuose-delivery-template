/**
 * Represents a Global Address resource. Global addresses are used for
 * HTTP(S) load balancing.
 *
 * To get more information about GlobalAddress, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/v1/globalAddresses)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Reserving a Static External IP Address](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-external-ip-address)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Global Address Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultGlobalAddress = new gcp.compute.GlobalAddress("default", {});
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * GlobalAddress can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/globalAddress:GlobalAddress default projects/{{project}}/global/addresses/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/globalAddress:GlobalAddress default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/globalAddress:GlobalAddress default {{name}}
 * ```
