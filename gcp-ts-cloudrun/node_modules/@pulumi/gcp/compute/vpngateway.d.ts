/**
 * Represents a VPN gateway running in GCP. This virtual device is managed
 * by Google, but used only by you.
 *
 * To get more information about VpnGateway, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/targetVpnGateways)
 *
 * > **Warning:** Classic VPN is deprecating certain functionality on October 31, 2021. For more information,
 * see the [Classic VPN partial deprecation page](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/vpn/deprecations/classic-vpn-deprecation).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Target Vpn Gateway Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const network1 = new gcp.compute.Network("network1", {});
 * const targetGateway = new gcp.compute.VPNGateway("targetGateway", {network: network1.id});
 * const vpnStaticIp = new gcp.compute.Address("vpnStaticIp", {});
 * const frEsp = new gcp.compute.ForwardingRule("frEsp", {
 *     ipProtocol: "ESP",
 *     ipAddress: vpnStaticIp.address,
 *     target: targetGateway.id,
 * });
 * const frUdp500 = new gcp.compute.ForwardingRule("frUdp500", {
 *     ipProtocol: "UDP",
 *     portRange: "500",
 *     ipAddress: vpnStaticIp.address,
 *     target: targetGateway.id,
 * });
 * const frUdp4500 = new gcp.compute.ForwardingRule("frUdp4500", {
 *     ipProtocol: "UDP",
 *     portRange: "4500",
 *     ipAddress: vpnStaticIp.address,
 *     target: targetGateway.id,
 * });
 * const tunnel1 = new gcp.compute.VPNTunnel("tunnel1", {
 *     peerIp: "15.0.0.120",
 *     sharedSecret: "a secret message",
 *     targetVpnGateway: targetGateway.id,
 * }, {
 *     dependsOn: [
 *         frEsp,
 *         frUdp500,
 *         frUdp4500,
 *     ],
 * });
 * const route1 = new gcp.compute.Route("route1", {
 *     network: network1.name,
 *     destRange: "15.0.0.0/24",
 *     priority: 1000,
 *     nextHopVpnTunnel: tunnel1.id,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * VpnGateway can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/vPNGateway:VPNGateway default projects/{{project}}/regions/{{region}}/targetVpnGateways/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/vPNGateway:VPNGateway default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/vPNGateway:VPNGateway default {{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/vPNGateway:VPNGateway default {{name}}
 * ```
