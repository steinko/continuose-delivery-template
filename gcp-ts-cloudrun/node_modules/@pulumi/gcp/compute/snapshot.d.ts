/**
 * Represents a Persistent Disk Snapshot resource.
 *
 * Use snapshots to back up data from your persistent disks. Snapshots are
 * different from public images and custom images, which are used primarily
 * to create instances or configure instance templates. Snapshots are useful
 * for periodic backup of the data on your persistent disks. You can create
 * snapshots from persistent disks even while they are attached to running
 * instances.
 *
 * Snapshots are incremental, so you can create regular snapshots on a
 * persistent disk faster and at a much lower cost than if you regularly
 * created a full image of the disk.
 *
 * To get more information about Snapshot, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/rest/v1/snapshots)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/create-snapshots)
 *
 * > **Warning:** All arguments including `snapshot_encryption_key.raw_key` and `source_disk_encryption_key.raw_key` will be stored in the raw
 * state as plain-text. [Read more about secrets in state](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/programming-model/#secrets).
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Snapshot Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const debian = gcp.compute.getImage({
 *     family: "debian-9",
 *     project: "debian-cloud",
 * });
 * const persistent = new gcp.compute.Disk("persistent", {
 *     image: debian.then(debian => debian.selfLink),
 *     size: 10,
 *     type: "pd-ssd",
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",
 * });
 * const snapshot = new gcp.compute.Snapshot("snapshot", {
 *     sourceDisk: persistent.name,
 *     zone: "us-central1-a",
 *     labels: {
 *         my_label: "value",
 *     },
 *     storageLocations: ["us-central1"],
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Snapshot can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/snapshot:Snapshot default projects/{{project}}/global/snapshots/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/snapshot:Snapshot default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:compute/snapshot:Snapshot default {{name}}
 * ```
