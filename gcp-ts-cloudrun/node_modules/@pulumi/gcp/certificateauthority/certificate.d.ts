/**
 * A Certificate corresponds to a signed X.509 certificate issued by a CertificateAuthority.
 *
 * > **Note:** The Certificate Authority that is referenced by this resource **must** be
 * `tier = "ENTERPRISE"`
 *
 * > **Warning:** Please remember that all resources created during preview (via this provider)
 * will be deleted when CA service transitions to General Availability (GA). Relying on these
 * certificate authorities for production traffic is discouraged.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Privateca Certificate Csr
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 * import * from "fs";
 *
 * const test_ca = new gcp.certificateauthority.Authority("test-ca", {
 *     certificateAuthorityId: "my-certificate-authority",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     tier: "ENTERPRISE",
 *     config: {
 *         subjectConfig: {
 *             subject: {
 *                 organization: "HashiCorp",
 *             },
 *             commonName: "my-certificate-authority",
 *             subjectAltName: {
 *                 dnsNames: ["hashicorp.com"],
 *             },
 *         },
 *         reusableConfig: {
 *             reusableConfig: "projects/568668481468/locations/us-central1/reusableConfigs/root-unconstrained",
 *         },
 *     },
 *     keySpec: {
 *         algorithm: "RSA_PKCS1_4096_SHA256",
 *     },
 *     disableOnDelete: true,
 * }, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * const _default = new gcp.certificateauthority.Certificate("default", {
 *     project: "my-project-name",
 *     location: "us-central1",
 *     certificateAuthority: test_ca.certificateAuthorityId,
 *     lifetime: "860s",
 *     pemCsr: fs.readFileSync("test-fixtures/rsa_csr.pem"),
 * }, {
 *     provider: google_beta,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Certificate can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:certificateauthority/certificate:Certificate default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/certificateAuthorities/{{certificate_authority}}/certificates/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:certificateauthority/certificate:Certificate default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{certificate_authority}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:certificateauthority/certificate:Certificate default {{location}}/{{certificate_authority}}/{{name}}
 * ```
