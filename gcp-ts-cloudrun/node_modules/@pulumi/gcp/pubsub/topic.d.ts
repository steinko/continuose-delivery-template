/**
 * A named resource to which messages are sent by publishers.
 *
 * To get more information about Topic, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.topics)
 * * How-to Guides

 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Pubsub Topic Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example = new gcp.pubsub.Topic("example", {
 *     labels: {
 *         foo: "bar",
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 * ### Pubsub Topic Cmek
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const keyRing = new gcp.kms.KeyRing("keyRing", {location: "global"});
 * const cryptoKey = new gcp.kms.CryptoKey("cryptoKey", {keyRing: keyRing.id});
 * const example = new gcp.pubsub.Topic("example", {kmsKeyName: cryptoKey.id});
 * ```
 * ### Pubsub Topic Geo Restricted
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example = new gcp.pubsub.Topic("example", {
 *     messageStoragePolicy: {
 *         allowedPersistenceRegions: ["europe-west3"],
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Topic can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:pubsub/topic:Topic default projects/{{project}}/topics/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:pubsub/topic:Topic default {{project}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:pubsub/topic:Topic default {{name}}
 * ```
