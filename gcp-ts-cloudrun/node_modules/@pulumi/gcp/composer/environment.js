/**
 * An environment for running orchestration tasks.
 *
 * Environments run Apache Airflow software on Google infrastructure.
 *
 * To get more information about Environments, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.environments)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Official Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs)
 *     * [Configuring Shared VPC for Composer Environments](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/how-to/managing/configuring-shared-vpc)
 * * [Apache Airflow Documentation](http://airflow.apache.org/)
 *
 * > **Warning:** We **STRONGLY** recommend you read the [GCP guides](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/how-to)
 *   as the Environment resource requires a long deployment process and involves several layers of GCP infrastructure,
 *   including a Kubernetes Engine cluster, Cloud Storage, and Compute networking resources. Due to limitations of the API,
 *   This provider will not be able to automatically find or manage many of these underlying resources. In particular:
 *   * It can take up to one hour to create or update an environment resource. In addition, GCP may only detect some
 *     errors in configuration when they are used (e.g. ~40-50 minutes into the creation process), and is prone to limited
 *     error reporting. If you encounter confusing or uninformative errors, please verify your configuration is valid
 *     against GCP Cloud Composer before filing bugs against this provider.
 *   * **Environments create Google Cloud Storage buckets that do not get cleaned up automatically** on environment
 *     deletion. [More about Composer's use of Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/concepts/cloud-storage).
 *   * Please review the [known issues](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/known-issues) for Composer if you are having problems.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Basic Usage
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const test = new gcp.composer.Environment("test", {
 *     region: "us-central1",
 * });
 * ```
 * ### With GKE and Compute Resource Dependencies
 *
 * **NOTE** To use custom service accounts, you need to give at least `role/composer.worker` to the service account being used by the GKE Nodes on the Composer project.
 * You may need to assign additional roles depending on what the Airflow DAGs will be running.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const testNetwork = new gcp.compute.Network("testNetwork", {autoCreateSubnetworks: false});
 * const testSubnetwork = new gcp.compute.Subnetwork("testSubnetwork", {
 *     ipCidrRange: "10.2.0.0/16",
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     network: testNetwork.id,
 * });
 * const testAccount = new gcp.serviceAccount.Account("testAccount", {
 *     accountId: "composer-env-account",
 *     displayName: "Test Service Account for Composer Environment",
 * });
 * const testEnvironment = new gcp.composer.Environment("testEnvironment", {
 *     region: "us-central1",
 *     config: {
 *         nodeCount: 4,
 *         nodeConfig: {
 *             zone: "us-central1-a",
 *             machineType: "e2-medium",
 *             network: testNetwork.id,
 *             subnetwork: testSubnetwork.id,
 *             serviceAccount: testAccount.name,
 *         },
 *     },
 * });
 * const composer_worker = new gcp.projects.IAMMember("composer-worker", {
 *     role: "roles/composer.worker",
 *     member: pulumi.interpolate`serviceAccount:${testAccount.email}`,
 * });
 * ```
 * ### With Software (Airflow) Config
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const test = new gcp.composer.Environment("test", {
 *     config: {
 *         softwareConfig: {
 *             airflowConfigOverrides: {
 *                 "core-load_example": "True",
 *             },
 *             envVariables: {
 *                 FOO: "bar",
 *             },
 *             pypiPackages: {
 *                 numpy: "",
 *                 scipy: "==1.1.0",
 *             },
 *         },
 *     },
 *     region: "us-central1",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Environment can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:composer/environment:Environment default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{region}}/environments/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:composer/environment:Environment default {{project}}/{{region}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:composer/environment:Environment default {{name}}
 * ```
