/**
 * Creates a table resource in a dataset for Google BigQuery. For more information see
 * [the official documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/) and
 * [API](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/rest/v2/tables).
 *
 * > **Note**: On newer versions of the provider, you must explicitly set `deletion_protection=false`
 * (and run `pulumi update` to write the field to state) in order to destroy an instance.
 * It is recommended to not set this field (or set it to true) until you're ready to destroy.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const defaultDataset = new gcp.bigquery.Dataset("defaultDataset", {
 *     datasetId: "foo",
 *     friendlyName: "test",
 *     description: "This is a test description",
 *     location: "EU",
 *     defaultTableExpirationMs: 3600000,
 *     labels: {
 *         env: "default",
 *     },
 * });
 * const defaultTable = new gcp.bigquery.Table("defaultTable", {
 *     datasetId: defaultDataset.datasetId,
 *     tableId: "bar",
 *     timePartitioning: {
 *         type: "DAY",
 *     },
 *     labels: {
 *         env: "default",
 *     },
 *     schema: `[
 *   {
 *     "name": "permalink",
 *     "type": "STRING",
 *     "mode": "NULLABLE",
 *     "description": "The Permalink"
 *   },
 *   {
 *     "name": "state",
 *     "type": "STRING",
 *     "mode": "NULLABLE",
 *     "description": "State where the head office is located"
 *   }
 * ]
 * `,
 * });
 * const sheet = new gcp.bigquery.Table("sheet", {
 *     datasetId: defaultDataset.datasetId,
 *     tableId: "sheet",
 *     externalDataConfiguration: {
 *         autodetect: true,
 *         sourceFormat: "GOOGLE_SHEETS",
 *         googleSheetsOptions: {
 *             skipLeadingRows: 1,
 *         },
 *         sourceUris: ["https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/123456789012345"],
 *     },
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * BigQuery tables can be imported using the `project`, `dataset_id`, and `table_id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:bigquery/table:Table default gcp-project/foo/bar
 * ```
