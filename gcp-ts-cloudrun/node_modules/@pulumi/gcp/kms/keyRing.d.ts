/**
 * A `KeyRing` is a toplevel logical grouping of `CryptoKeys`.
 *
 * > **Note:** KeyRings cannot be deleted from Google Cloud Platform.
 * Destroying a provider-managed KeyRing will remove it from state but
 * *will not delete the resource from the project.*
 *
 * To get more information about KeyRing, see:
 *
 * * [API documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.keyRings)
 * * How-to Guides
 *     * [Creating a key ring](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/creating-keys#create_a_key_ring)
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 * ### Kms Key Ring Basic
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as gcp from "@pulumi/gcp";
 *
 * const example_keyring = new gcp.kms.KeyRing("example-keyring", {
 *     location: "global",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * KeyRing can be imported using any of these accepted formats
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:kms/keyRing:KeyRing default projects/{{project}}/locations/{{location}}/keyRings/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:kms/keyRing:KeyRing default {{project}}/{{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
 *
 * ```sh
 *  $ pulumi import gcp:kms/keyRing:KeyRing default {{location}}/{{name}}
 * ```
